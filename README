- You can run the code directly using the .jar file or the .class executables, or you can access and compile the source code yourself from the "source" folder.

- The algorithm needs the Loandra solver to be installed.

- There needs to be 3 folders called "clauses", "solutions", and "logs" next to the JAR file.

Parameters:

-d [value]: tree depth
-print: to print the results
-weighted [matrix]: misclassification costs (in case of unbalanced costs)
-support [value]: minimum support
-margin [value]: minimum margin
-timeout [value]: timeout limit (in minutes)
-path [string]: the path to the loandra solver
-post [string]: a postfix to distinguish the name of the files stored in the three folders

Dataset:
- The name of the dataset should come at the end of the command
- The dataset file should be named "instance_[dataset name]"
- The dataset format is:
	[n] (size of the dataset)
	[f] (number of features)
	[c] (number of labels)
	each line: first the features and then the label, separated by space


Example:

java -jar SAT_Classifier.jar -print -margin 1 -d 2 -post _test -timeout 15 -path ~/SAT_Project/loandra-master/loandra_static cryotherapy
java -jar SAT_Classifier.jar -weighted 0-2-1-0 -d 3 -post _w immunotherapy
